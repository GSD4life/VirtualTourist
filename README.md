# VirtualTourist - IOS Application built as part of Udacity's IOS Nanodegree program

The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. Users will be able to drop pins on a map, download pictures for the location, and save favorites to their device.

## Features:

1) TravelLocationsMapView - allows the user to drop pin(s) on the map for any location around the world. Tapping and holding the map drops a new pin. When a pin is tapped the app will transition to the Photo Album view associated with that pin.
